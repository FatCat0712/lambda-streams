# Stream In Java

## Stream API is used to process collections of objects
A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.

A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels

Streams don't change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods

## Why we need stream ?
Functional Programming
Code Reduce
Bulk Operation

## Methods:
Filter - for conditional check \
forEach - for iteration
